If you're an Epicodus student or anybody wondering which language to learn, the first thing you need to decide
          is if you want to focus more on front-end or back-end development.
           Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take CSS and Design classes at Epicodus. If you're more
            interested in back-end development, you have several choices of languages: C#, Java, PHP, and Ruby are all offered at Epicodus. My best advice about how to choose is not to worry too much.</p>
          <p> Most modern programming languages have more similarities than differences, and Epicodus graduates often find themselves working in different languages than they studied in school.</p>
          <p> Back-end programmers often switch languages as they change jobs, or even as they build different types of software at the same job. So don't stress too much about making the right choice! That said, each language has found a bit of a niche,
            and depending on your interests, you might be attracted to one over another.</p>
          <h4>"The most important thing is to get the basic principles of coding down, practice a lot, and be ready to change to another language when your job inevitably does."</h4>
